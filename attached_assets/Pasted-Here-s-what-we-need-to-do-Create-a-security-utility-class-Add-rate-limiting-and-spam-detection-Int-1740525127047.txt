Here's what we need to do:

Create a security utility class
Add rate limiting and spam detection
Integrate it with the contacts endpoint

Let's start by creating the security utility file:utils/security-utility.phpClick to open codeTap to openNow, let's update the api-proxy.php file to use this security utility for the contacts endpoint:api-proxy.php UpdatesClick to open codeTap to openNow we need to update the configuration file to include security settings:config-file.php UpdatesClick to open codeTap to openFinally, let's make a small update to the contact form to work with our security measures:react-contact-form-update.jsxClick to open codeTap to openImplementation Summary: Public Endpoint with Security Measures
I've created a comprehensive security implementation for your contacts endpoint while keeping it public. Here's what each file does:
1. Security Utility (utils/security-utility.php)

Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 5 submissions per hour)
Adds spam detection to block suspicious submissions
Creates a rate_limits database table to track submission attempts
Includes IP address detection and management
Adds methods for cleaning up old rate limit records

2. API Proxy Updates (api-proxy.php)

Integrates the security utility
Applies rate limiting and spam detection to contact form submissions
Maintains contacts as a public endpoint but with protection
Includes proper file path fixes (changed to use -file.php extensions)
Adds periodic cleanup of old rate limit records

3. Configuration Updates (config-file.php)

Adds new security settings section
Configures rate limiting parameters (limit, period)
Adds spam protection settings
Includes honeypot field configuration

4. React Contact Form Updates (react-contact-form-update.jsx)

Adds a honeypot field to catch bots (hidden field that should remain empty)
Improves error handling for rate limit responses
Keeps token support (even though endpoint is public)
Adds silent failure for bot detection

How This Works

When a user submits the contact form, the React component sends the data to your API
The API first checks rate limits based on the user's IP address
If the user hasn't exceeded limits, the API checks for spam indicators
If the submission passes these checks, it's processed normally
The React form includes a hidden honeypot field that humans won't fill, but bots will

Benefits of This Approach

Keeps the simplicity of a public endpoint
Adds protection against abuse and spam
Doesn't require complex token management on the frontend
Uses multiple layers of security (rate limiting, spam detection, honeypot)
Maintains compatibility with your current setup

Next Steps

Deploy these changes to your server
Test the contact form to ensure it works correctly
Monitor logs for any rate limit or spam blocks
Adjust rate limits and spam detection as needed based on real-world usage

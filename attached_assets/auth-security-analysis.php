// From api-proxy.php:
$public_endpoints = [
    'contacts' => true  // Make contacts endpoint public for form submissions
];

if (!isset($public_endpoints[$module])) {
    $auth = new Auth($db, $config);
    $token_data = $auth->authenticate();
}

// Contact Form Security:
// - The contacts endpoint is public (doesn't require authentication)
// - This allows the React form to submit without a token
// - But the React form code still includes the token in the submission:
//   Authorization: `Bearer ${apiToken}`

// The options are:

// Option 1: Keep contacts as public endpoint (current approach)
// - No need for token in React form
// - Increased risk of abuse/spam if not protected
// - Implementation:
//   - Remove token from React form OR
//   - Add server-side rate limiting and spam protection

// Option 2: Make contacts require authentication
// - More secure
// - Requires valid token management on the front-end
// - Implementation:
//   - Remove 'contacts' from $public_endpoints
//   - Ensure React form has valid token

// From data flows.md, the recommended approach is:
// "Server-side proxy (recommended):
// Frontend makes requests to your own backend
// Your backend proxy forwards to SuiteCRM with the token"

// This would be the most secure approach and aligns with the documentation.

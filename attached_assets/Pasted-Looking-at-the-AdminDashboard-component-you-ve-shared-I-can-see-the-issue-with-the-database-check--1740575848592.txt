Looking at the AdminDashboard component you've shared, I can see the issue with the database check. Let me review the test setup and identify what's causing the "Database check failed" error.

## Analysis of the Test Setup

1. The AdminDashboard component makes a query to `/api/db-check` endpoint to check the database connection status.

2. The error is happening because this endpoint is either:
   - Not properly implemented on your backend
   - Not correctly connecting to your database
   - Returning an error response

3. The component itself is well structured, but it depends on having these backend endpoints available:
   - `/health` for overall API health
   - `/api/db-check` for database connectivity

## Missing Backend Implementation

The key issue here is that while your frontend is making a request to `/api/db-check`, this endpoint likely doesn't exist or isn't properly connected to your database. 

Let me provide a sample implementation for this endpoint that should work with your SuiteCRM database:

Also, let's implement the health check endpoint:



## Implementation for a PHP Backend

If you're using PHP for your backend instead of Node.js, here's how you would implement these endpoints:



## Frontend Adjustment to Fix Path Issues

If your API endpoints are actually at `/custom-api/api-proxy.php/health` and `/custom-api/api-proxy.php/db-check` but your frontend is trying to access `/health` and `/api/db-check`, you'll need to adjust the paths:





## Recommendations to Fix Your Database Check Issue

Based on my analysis, here are the steps to fix your "Database check failed" error:

1. **Check if your backend has the required endpoints**:
   - `/api/db-check` for database health
   - `/health` for overall API health

2. **Implement the missing endpoints** using one of the approaches I've provided:
   - Use the Node.js/Express implementation if your backend is JavaScript-based
   - Use the PHP implementation if your backend is PHP-based

3. **Ensure paths match between frontend and backend**:
   - If your API is at `/custom-api/api-proxy.php`, update your frontend to use the full path
   - Alternatively, implement proxy endpoints that maintain the current paths your frontend expects

4. **Verify your database credentials**:
   - Double-check that the database connection parameters are correct
   - Ensure your database server allows connections from your API server

5. **Test with proper error handling**:
   - Use the logs in your AdminDashboard to see detailed error information
   - Check your server logs for any database connection errors

## Implementation Recommendation

I recommend implementing the PHP endpoints in your existing SuiteCRM API proxy since you're already using it for your contacts endpoint. This would be the most straightforward approach.

= SuiteCRM Data Integration

SuiteCRM Data Integration is an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) solution that connects to an existing 
SuiteCRM installation to extract source data from the MySQL database and load that into the Data Warehouse, 
that has been optimised for analytical functions. SuiteCRM Data Integration can be installed as a stand-alone 
solution and can be used with other reporting tools if desired.

== Downloading & Installing SuiteCRM Data Integration

SuiteCRM Data Integration requires the following pre-requisites installed on your server

* Linux environment
* OpenJDK 8 JRE (Java)
* wget
* unzip
* zip
* Mysql server + an empty MySQL database

There are two ways of downloading the SuiteCRM Data Integration.

* https://suitecrm.com/resources/suitecrm-analytics-tool[Download from SuiteCRM website^]: a pre-built 
package containing installation scripts, web server and all the third party open source libraries required.
* Clone the SuiteCRM Data Integration repo: a script to build the SuiteCRM data integration package 
(generating the same available package via the SuiteCRM website).

=== Manually Build the package (cloning from repo)

Clone repo via terminal:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ivylabs/suitecrm-data-integration
----

Navigate into the newly clone repository's directory and run `build.sh`.

[source,bash]
----
./build.sh
----

This should output on your terminal all the files that the solution downloads and zips up into a package.
The end of the script will ask if you wish to delete the installation files.

[source,bash]
----
Would you like to remove the installation files? This will save disk space. [y/N] y

-------------------------------------------------------------

 Build is complete!

-------------------------------------------------------------
----

This will generate a package named `suitecrm-data-integration-server.zip` within the root of your directory. 
This is the same package available via the SuiteCRM website.

=== Configuring SuiteCRM Data Integration

After downloading or generating the `suitecrm-data-integration-server.zip` file, **Upload** and **extract** this 
file on a hosted web server.

Navigate into the newly extracted `suitecrm-data-integration-server` folder and edit the `install.properties`.

SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_USERNAME=suitecrmrootuser
SUITECRM_ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=suitecrmrootuserpassword
----

The SMTP config variables will define the connection to an email mail client to send out notifications 
on the status of the extraction script (success or failure). These are optional.

== Installing SuiteCRM Data Integration

Once the configuration has been defined, now run the setup script within the same root directory of 
your `suitecrm-data-integration`.

[source,bash]
----
./setup-suitecrm-data-integration.sh
----

This will check the connection of your databases and create the tables required to extract your SuiteCRM data.

Then you can run the SuiteCRM Data Integration script to extract and transform your data.

[source,bash]
----
./run-suitecrm-data-integration.sh
----

This should output on your terminal all logging referring to the extracting, transforming and loading data 
into the data warehouse tables.

The solution currently extracts data from the following modules:

* Accounts
* Campaigns
* Cases
* Contacts
* Invoices
* Leads
* Opportunities
* Products/Product Categories
* Users
* Custom Fields from Cases,Leads

This is the end of the SuiteCRM Data Integration installation. If you wish to know more about Pentaho ETL 
solutions you can visit the https://wiki.pentaho.com/display/EAI/Spoon+User+Guide[Spoon user guide^].
This solution includes a pre-packaged spoon client that you can run via terminal.

=== Installing SuiteCRM Web Analytics

Once the configuration has been defined, now run the setup script within the same root directory of 
your suitecrm-analytics-server.

[source,bash]
----
./setup-suitecrm-analytics.sh
----

This will check that the web server can successfully run and the database connections are successful.

Then you can run the SuiteCRM Web Analytics web server to access the application.

[source,bash]
----
./start-suitecrm-analytics.sh
----

This should output on your terminal that the tomcat server has started.

To follow the web server logs you can run this command:

[source,bash]
----
tail -f tomcat/logs/catalina.out
----

To confirm the server has successfully started look for the following line in the above log file 
with `N` as a dynamic number depending on how quickly the server initialised.

[source,bash]
----
org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in N ms
----

Once the server has initialised you can log into the SuiteCRM Analytics Web Application by navigating 
to the hostname or IP address of the server in your web browser.
By default the web application is listening on port `8080` so for example, your server may be 
available on `http://localhost:8080/suitecrmanalytics`.

Check out the link:../../../user/suitecrm-analytics/1.1/scrm-analytics-getting-started[SuiteCRM Analytics User Guide] for 
more information on the application.

I'll carefully review the CRM API files and the website integration to ensure they're properly aligned. Let me analyze the code structure and identify any potential misalignments or issues.

## API Structure Analysis

The API you've built follows a modular architecture with:
- Core components (database, auth, response)
- Module-specific handlers (contacts, meetings)
- Utility classes (validation, formatting, logging)

### Main Entry Point

Looking at `api-proxy.php`, this serves as the entry point for all API requests. It:
1. Loads configuration
2. Sets up CORS headers
3. Handles request routing to appropriate modules
4. Provides authentication (except for public endpoints)

### Key Issue: Module File Path Discrepancies

I've noticed a critical issue with the file paths in the module imports:

In `api-proxy.php`, there are reference to files like:
```php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/modules/contacts/routes.php');
```

But I see two different routes.php files for contacts:
1. `/modules/contacts/contacts-routes.php` (comprehensive version)
2. `/modules/contacts/routes.php` (simplified version)

The same applies to other module files where the paths referenced don't match the actual file structure.

## Fixing Path Alignment Issues

Let me propose the necessary changes to align the files properly:

## React Integration Analysis

Now, let's examine how the React front-end integrates with this API:

The `react-contact-form.jsx` component is designed to communicate directly with your custom API. Here's what it does:

1. Takes API URL and token as props
2. Manages form state and validation
3. Submits data to the `/contacts` endpoint
4. Handles success/error responses

It looks well-structured, but there are a few things to check for alignment with the API:

## Authentication and Security Analysis

Next, let's look at authentication and security alignment:



## Implementation Recommendations

Based on the analysis, let me provide concrete recommendations to align the API and website integration:

## Summary and Next Steps

After reviewing the CRM API files and website integration, I've identified several misalignments that need to be addressed for proper functioning:

### Key Issues Found:

1. **File path mismatches**: The include paths in various files don't match the actual file names, which will cause PHP errors.

2. **Authentication inconsistency**: The contacts endpoint is marked as public, but the React form still sends an authorization token.

3. **Field alignment**: There are some fields validated by the API that aren't present in the React form.

4. **Response handling**: The React form might need adjustments to properly handle the API's response format.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Fix file paths**: Update the require paths in api-proxy.php and module files to match the actual filenames.

2. **Decide on authentication approach**: Either:
   - Keep contacts public but add rate limiting and CSRF protection
   - Require authentication and properly manage tokens
   - Implement the server-side proxy approach mentioned in your documentation

3. **Align field validation**: Ensure form fields in React match what the API expects.

4. **Test the integration**: After making these changes, test the full flow from form submission to CRM record creation.

Would you like me to provide specific code changes for any of these recommendations? Or would you prefer to focus on a particular aspect of the integration?

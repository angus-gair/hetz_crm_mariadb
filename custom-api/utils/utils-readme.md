I'll continue implementing the error.php utility that complements your logger and formatter:

I've now created three comprehensive utilities to enhance your modular SuiteCRM API proxy:

1. **Formatter Utility (`utils/formatter.php`)**:
   - Provides consistent data formatting throughout your API
   - Includes methods for formatting contacts, meetings, dates, phone numbers, and more
   - Handles data sanitization and transformation for API responses
   - Ensures consistent output format across all endpoints

2. **Logger Utility (`utils/logger.php`)**:
   - Implements a production-ready logging system with multiple log levels
   - Uses a singleton pattern to ensure consistent logging throughout the application
   - Includes specialized methods for logging API requests, responses, exceptions, and database queries
   - Supports contextual logging with interpolation of variables
   - Handles file rotation and directory creation
   - Registers error and exception handlers for comprehensive logging

3. **Error Handler (`core/error.php`)**:
   - Provides consistent error handling across your application
   - Captures PHP errors, uncaught exceptions, and fatal errors
   - Sends standardized error responses to API clients
   - Includes specialized methods for common HTTP error codes (404, 401, 403, 429, etc.)
   - Handles security event logging
   - Manages debug vs. production error output

These utilities work together to provide a robust foundation for your API:

```php
// In your main api-proxy.php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/core/error.php');
require_once(__DIR__ . '/utils/logger.php');
require_once(__DIR__ . '/utils/formatter.php');

// Initialize error handling
ErrorHandler::initialize($config);

// Start logging the request
Logger::logRequest($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], $api_path, $_GET);

try {
    // API logic here...
    
    // Format response data
    $formattedContacts = Formatter::formatCollection($contacts, [Formatter::class, 'formatContact']);
    
    // Send response
    Response::success(['contacts' => $formattedContacts]);
    
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Error handling is done automatically via the registered exception handler
    // The error will be logged and a proper response sent to the client
}
```

These utilities add several key benefits to your implementation:

1. **Improved debugging and troubleshooting** with comprehensive logging
2. **Consistent error handling** across all modules and endpoints
3. **Standardized data formatting** for a professional API experience
4. **Enhanced security** with proper error sanitization in production
5. **Better user experience** with appropriate error responses

The code is production-ready with features like:
- Log file rotation (daily logs)
- Configurable log levels
- Security event tracking
- Context-aware error responses (debug vs. production)
- Input/output sanitization
- Performance tracking

Would you like me to provide examples of how to integrate these utilities into your existing modules or any other specific guidance on implementing them?
